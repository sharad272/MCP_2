## Technical Implementation

### Smart Pattern Recognition:
```python
# Team extraction
team_pattern = r'([A-Za-z\s]+?)\s+(?:vs?\.?|v\.?)\s+([A-Za-z\s]+)'

# Score extraction
score_patterns = [
    r'(\d+)-(\d+)',     # 123-456
    r'(\d+)\s*:\s*(\d+)', # 123:456
    r'(\d+)\s+(\d+)',   # 123 456
]
```

### Relevance Scoring:
```python
def calculate_relevance_score(result):
    if is_sports:
        # Boost sports keywords
        score += sum(5 for keyword in sports_keywords if keyword in title)
        # Boost sports sources
        score += sum(10 for source in sports_sources if source in source_name)
        # Extra boost for live content
        if "live" in title: score += 15
```
